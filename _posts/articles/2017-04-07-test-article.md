Global Africa, the geographically and socio-culturally diverse peoples ofAfrica and its diaspora, is linked through complex networks of social relationships and processes. Whether examined at the level of the household, neighborhood, village, city, province, state, or region, the experiences ofthese dispersed peoples are multi  layered, interactively varied, and complex, and yet constituted of and mediated  within a global and unequal social ordering system. Here, our task is to actively engage in disaggregating these complexities in relation to the problems identified for  social action and analysis, the development of a more definitive knowledge base, and  the promotion of public understanding and informed discussion.
